## About
The primary goal of QueueShare is to allow the sharing of music in social settings. We've all had times when we're on the aux and been bombarded with song requests. 
QueueShare aims to tackles this problem by allowing a user to share their Spotify queue, and allow others to add songs to it. The host user can set restrictions on which type of songs may be added, or how many songs can be added.
